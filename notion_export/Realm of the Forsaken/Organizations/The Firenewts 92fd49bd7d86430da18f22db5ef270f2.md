# The Firenewts

Tags: Organization

Bandits, only known as the Firenewts, have taken over Stonespost, looting the remainder of the town after the undead left. They captured and killed a wood elf, who looks to be a druid, many mushrooms growing from her brimmed hat. The Firenewts plan to sell her ears.
