- The Cult started their capture at the Festival of Light, a local festival in Kalnaer celebrating Pelor and their kingdoms Chosen Child. The cult also began a raid on Dorgaete Castle, searching for the Elven artifact, The Eye of Orcus, a relic that aids in the reanimation of corpses and allows the undead to turn living beings to undead though biting.
- The Cult aims to amass an undead army for Tharizdun
- Underneath Duargate, the northern mining town of Kalnaer, is an Duergar city dungeon where they are protecting an elven tomb or treasure. Axon, the leader of the Order believes an ancient tomb for accessing the Abyss can be found here.
