- Royal family of Kalnaer
- Indebted to the North Ridge Trading Company
- Borrowed too much money from one of the Banking clans and their debt was sold to the NRTC
- The NRTC is using the Kals to locate and raid ancient elven artifacts scattered around the country.
- The NTRC is controlling the Kals reign so that this is their priority and all other matters are unimportant.
