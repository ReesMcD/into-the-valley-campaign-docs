# Summary

Rikoris Ellamir, a half-elf sorcerer, comes from a once-great family that has fallen into ruin due to his uncle and father's squandering of their fortune. Rikoris seeks to reconnect with his family's ancient magic by traveling to Kalnaer and proving his worth through deeds, not wealth. He faces challenges along the way, including discovering ancient elven armor, flashbacks to his dragon-riding ancestors, and being tested by elven spirits.

# Backstory

For a thousand years, the House of Ellamir had been one of the nineteen Great Houses of Obolo. According to family legend, their ancestor, Therrora of Ellamir, was a powerful sorcerer Elf who led the elves that first tamed the wilds of Dandillo and became the first settlers there. Originally from the lands of Kalnaer, he and other elves left for Dandillo when the King of the Nine Kingdoms began to consolidate his power and became increasingly hostile to elves. Over the next thousand years, the Ellamir family tended to the land, built great towns, and integrated with the local human population. The Ellamir House ruled their subjects justly and commanded the respect of the other Great Houses.

However, prosperity ended when Rikoris's uncle inherited the Ellamir Throne. For the past hundred years, Rikoris's uncle and father had squandered their good fortune as quickly as possible. They sold vast tracts of land to pay off gambling debts and spent their days in a drunken stupor. The palace guard was corrupt and people were leaving their towns and farms for better opportunities. They had lost the respect of the other Great Houses, and soon their name may be worthless too.

Despite his family's irresponsibility, Rikoris had grown up in luxury. He wore the finest clothes and ate the richest foods. He studied under the most powerful sorcerer in Dandillo and learned to harness his Draconic magic. However, from inside the manor walls, he saw the world leaving his family behind. Unlike his uncle, he had left the manor and talked to commoners, had an audience with other Great Houses, and seen that true power requires more than just wealth; it demands bravery, fortitude, and wisdom.

Therefore, Rikoris decided to travel to Kalnaer, Therrora of Ellamir's ancestral land, to find the ancient remains of the elven town Therrora left and reconnect with his family's ancient magic. He would prove his worth through deeds, not wealth. The Nine Kingdoms had collapsed, and the land was in chaos. He would test himself in battle and prove to the world that the Ellamir name still had a noble spirit. Then he would return to Obolo and claim what he deserved from his uncle.

Rikoris knew his journey to Kalnaer would be difficult. He had never risked his life before or lived far from home. He would need to make allies and prove himself as a leader, ruthlessly dispatch enemies, and be humble and gracious to those he met, even commoners. But these difficulties would bring him closer to the spirit that made his ancestors great.

Character thoughts as of session 35:

*“Hero of the High Moon. I quite like the sound of that title. Earned in battle and grit, a testament to both the power of my sorcery, and the power of the allies I’ve made. To be honest, I’ve never felt anything like this before. To be in battle, with my life truly on the line, is the most exhilarating thing I’ve ever felt. It’s not something I’ve ever seen from inside the walls of my Uncle’s Keep. No, I’ve learned more about how to be a man in just the past month than in my entire life at home. I have fought for my life - and the life of other - and won, time and time again. My powers have doubled since I’ve left home. Perhaps even surpassed those of my old mentor. I feel like I can take on anything now - or soon, at least. I’d best not get too proud, Olympia wouldn’t like it.*

*And my new friends here! A very odd bunch, to say the least. As my physical and magical powers have grown, so too have my charismatic abilities. This funny little group has begun to look to me for leadership and inspiration. It shall be another test for me, less dangerous but just as important. For how can I expect to rule my family’s land without the respect and adoration of those who follow me? I must continue to prove myself as a leader and a visionary, and guide our party in the right direction. I will need allies for the fight ahead.*

*I believe I am finding what I came here to look for. The presence of my ancestors are strong in this land, I can feel their energy surround me. The elves of this land have been beaten back by terrible evil, but their strength is a deep as the tombs we’ve found. Perhaps the wood elves who still live here can provide more insight, despite how primitive they are now. As I have only more questions as time goes on. Am I truly descended from the dragon riders who once ruled this land? Can I channel their dormant energy? Could I be destined to be a dragon rider myself?*

*But I mustn’t get ahead of myself. For now, we have more urgent tasks at hand. This undead army could threaten the entire realm. The North Ridge trading company is threatening the stability of this whole land for profit. Egoleran is plagued by…well, plague. And I am still getting to know myself, my new powers, my new friends. I do hope I’m not in too deep here. Does the Red Chaos really stand for the good they say? Are we taking on an evil we can’t hope to defeat? Will this party, these Nights of Kale, really be the allies I need? One of them was raised by otters, another is a wanted criminal back in my homeland, and another has made some deal with a demon I can hardly comprehend. I’ll need to help them get to the bottom of their own problems, as well as my own. But I hope they’ll be as willing to help me as I am.*

*Perhaps I should write to Caryana and Joruin. They always were so good with advice. After all, they were the ones who really brought me outside the keep’s walls. They showed me the conditions the peasants lived in while my family squandered their luxury. They showed me the other lands of Dandillo in a way my family never could. They will have the right advice for me. And maybe they could even send me my flute…”*
