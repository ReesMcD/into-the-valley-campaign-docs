# The Calamity and the Four Guardians of the Realm

Once upon a time, the realm was a peaceful and harmonious place, until the nefarious Cult of Nessus unearthed an ancient gate to Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. This gate had been buried for millennia and was whispered to be the key to unleashing unimaginable power. With the gate broken, devils and demons poured into the realm, causing chaos and destruction.

It was soon discovered that the archdevil Zariel was behind this wickedness, manipulating the cult for her own purposes. Zariel was a fallen angel and the ruler of Avernus who had long dedicated herself to winning the unending Blood War between devils and demons. Her plan was to open Avernus to the Material Plane and redirect the planar connection to the Abyss, thus purging demons from Avernus.

The people knew this event as The Calamity, and it plunged the entire realm into a dark and tumultuous time. Demons and devils fought each other relentlessly on the Material Plane, causing destruction and death wherever they went.

However, amidst the chaos, four great heroes emerged. Ragnor the Brash, Aldo the Noble, Lunete the Wise, and Mal the Omen became known as the Four Guardians of the Realm. Each coming from different corners of the realm, fortuitous circumstances brought these four together, and some believe the gods themselves influenced this.

Raised in the Calamity, the Four Guardians were battle-hardened from a young age. They found themselves in a position to disrupt the plan that Zariel, the archdevil and ruler of Avernus, had set forth. Zariel aimed to redirect the planar connection to the Abyss, thus ridding demons from Avernus and winning the unending Blood War.

The Four Guardians came together to defeat Zariel and seal the gate to Avernus once and for all. Journeying into Avernus, they faced unimaginable horrors but eventually slew Zariel and closed the gate. However, in the process, they became trapped in Avernus, unable to return to the Material Plane.

And so, dear reader, the tale of The Calamity and the Four Guardians of the Realm shall be told for generations to come, a story of bravery, heroism, and sacrifice.

# Gods and their Creations

Once upon a time, in a world long ago, the realm was a place of wonder and magic. The Dawn War Deities, also known as the Gods, were powerful beings who filled the world with creatures, plants, and monsters that were imbued with magic that would last for generations. Though the Gods fought together in the Dawn War, they did not always agree, and some of them were even mortal enemies.

As the Gods tried to make their own creations more powerful than those of the other Gods, a great conflict arose. Monsters and creatures ran wild across the Material Plane, and the Gods fought for dominance. In response to this chaos, a few of the Gods decided to create a powerful species to rule over the Plane. This species possessed great magic, technology, and diplomacy, and brought stability to the Material Plane, but not everyone was pleased with their intervention.

Other Gods created the Elves to fight against this ruling species. This sparked another war, which ended with the eradication of the ancient species by the Elves. Sadly, the name, lineage, and culture of the ancient species were lost to time. In the aftermath of this conflict, the Elves harnessed the technology and magic of the ancient species to begin their own great rule over the Material Plane.

And so, not much more is known about this time, as a significant portion of its history was either destroyed or rewritten by the Elves. But the realm continued to be a place of magic and wonder, where new stories and legends were born every day.

# The Dawn War

Once upon a time, in a world of chaos and danger, the Material Plane was ruled by powerful entities known as the Primordials. But the Dawn War Deities, who we now call the Gods, saw this as an opportunity to bring order and stability to the world. Descending from the heavens, they waged the Dawn War against the Primordials, a great and brutal conflict that shaped the oceans, mountains, and lands of the Material Plane.

After a long and fierce battle, the Gods emerged victorious and banished the defeated Primordials to a dark plane where they would spend eternity. The Gods then divided the ruling territory among various planes but decided to make the Material Plane a common ground for their creations, with the understanding that they would limit their intervention.

As the Dawn War subsided, conflicts between the Gods rose once again. Notably, Tharizdun was imprisoned in the Abyss, a plane he himself invented. Tharizdun’s imprisonment spurred the creation (or at least alignment) of demons in the Abyss. Asmodeus, ruler of the Nine Hells, was tasked with guarding the Abyss, initiating the Blood War, a war between the demons of the Abyss and the devils of the Nine Hells. And thus, dear reader, the tale of the Dawn War is told for generations to come, a story of gods, monsters, and the dawn of a new era.
