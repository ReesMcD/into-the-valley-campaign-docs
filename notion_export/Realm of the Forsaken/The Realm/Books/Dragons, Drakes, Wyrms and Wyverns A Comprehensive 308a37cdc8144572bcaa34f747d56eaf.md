Dragons, Drakes, Wyrms and Wyverns: A Comprehensive Guide

By Thalindra Firebrand, Professor of Draconic Studies at The Citadel 

## Introduction

As a scholar who has dedicated her life to the study of dragons and their kin, I present this comprehensive guide to these magnificent creatures. This tome covers not only true dragons but also their lesser relatives: drakes, wyrms, and wyverns. My research draws from ancient texts, firsthand observations, and consultations with some of the oldest and wisest dragons in existence.

## True Dragons

True dragons are among the most powerful and intelligent creatures in our world. They are divided into two main categories: chromatic and metallic, each with unique abilities and characteristics.

### Chromatic Dragons

Chromatic dragons are often associated with destructive forces and tyrannical behavior. They include:

- Red Dragons: Fire-breathing behemoths dwelling in mountains and volcanic regions
- Blue Dragons: Masters of lightning, preferring deserts and arid climates
- Green Dragons: Poison-breathing serpents inhabiting dense forests
- Black Dragons: Acid-spewing terrors found in swamps and marshes
- White Dragons: Frost-breathing hunters living in arctic and tundra environments

### Metallic Dragons

Metallic dragons are generally viewed as noble and benevolent, though they can be fierce when provoked. They include:

- Gold Dragons: Fire-breathing and considered the most powerful and majestic
- Silver Dragons: Cold-breathing dragons known for their fascination with humanoid cultures
- Bronze Dragons: Lightning-wielding protectors often found near coastlines
- Copper Dragons: Acid-breathing tricksters known for their playful and mischievous nature
- Brass Dragons: Fire-breathing inhabitants of deserts, renowned for their love of conversation

## Drakes, Wyrms, and Wyverns

Often mistaken for true dragons, these creatures have distinct differences:

- Drakes: Lesser dragon-like creatures, often lacking wings or breath weapons
- Wyrms: While sometimes used interchangeably with "dragon," this term often denotes particularly ancient and powerful individuals
- Wyverns: Dragon-like creatures with two legs and wings, less intelligent than true dragons

## The Mystery of Dragon Eggs

The hatching of dragon eggs remains one of the most enigmatic aspects of draconic life. My research suggests the following method, though I must stress that successful hatchings are exceedingly rare:

- Locate a suitable incubation site that matches the dragon's elemental affinity (e.g., volcanic caves for red dragons)
- Maintain a constant magical environment using complex rituals or powerful artifacts
- Protect the egg from would-be thieves or rival dragons
- Be prepared for a long wait - the incubation period can last for centuries, depending on the type of dragon

## Tiamat and Bahamut: The Dragon Deities

No discussion of dragons would be complete without mentioning the two most powerful draconic entities: Tiamat and Bahamut.

### Tiamat, the Dragon Queen

Tiamat is the fearsome goddess of evil dragons, greed, and vengeance. Legends describe her as a five-headed dragon, each head representing a chromatic dragon type. It is said she is imprisoned in the Nine Hells but constantly seeks to break free. Evil dragons, kobolds, and some dragon cultists are known to worship her.

### Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon

Bahamut is revered as the god of good dragons, justice, and nobility. He is often depicted as a majestic platinum dragon or disguised as an old man. According to ancient texts, he resides in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia. Metallic dragons, dragonborn, and those who seek justice are among his most devout followers.

## The Lost Legacy of Dragon Riders

Perhaps one of the most intriguing chapters in draconic history is that of the Dragon Riders. My research has uncovered tantalizing fragments of information about this ancient faction:

- An elite group of elves known as Dragon Riders once existed, being the first to form deep, magical bonds with dragons
- These Dragon Riders played a significant role in shaping the history of our world, particularly in the land of Elderen
- Historical records speak of their defeat by High King Adrianus in a legendary battle, though details remain shrouded in mystery
- Remnants of their legacy can be found in ancient tombs and artifacts, such as the fabled Hand of Zokenth
- Some individuals may have ancestral connections to these Dragon Riders, potentially unlocking dormant abilities or experiencing visions of the past

As with all aspects of draconic lore, much remains unknown about Dragon Riders. Their story serves as a reminder of the deep, often hidden connections between dragons and the other races of our world.

In conclusion, the study of dragons is a lifelong pursuit, filled with wonder, danger, and endless discovery. It is my hope that this guide will inspire a new generation of scholars to delve deeper into the mysteries of these magnificent creatures.
