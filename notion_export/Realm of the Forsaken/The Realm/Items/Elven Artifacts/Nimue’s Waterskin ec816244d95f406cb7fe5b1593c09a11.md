## Nimue's Waterskin

*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a druid)*

This enchanted waterskin was crafted by a legendary elven druid for those who revere the power of water. Its clear, flexible inner lining allows the user to see the water within, which seems to shimmer with an otherworldly glow.

While attuned to Nimue's Waterskin, you gain the following benefits:

- **Water Sense:** You can sense the presence of water within 60 feet of you, including its general direction and approximate volume.
- **Aqueous Manipulation:** You can cast the *shape water* cantrip at will.
- **Hydration Boost:** As an action, you can drink from the waterskin to regain 2d4 + 2 hit points. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.
- **Water Walking:** You can cast the *water walk* spell once per day without expending a spell slot.
- **Aquatic Adaptation:** You can breathe underwater and gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.
- **Tidal Surge:** As an action, you can unleash a powerful blast of water from the waterskin. Each creature in a 30-foot cone must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d6 bludgeoning damage and is pushed 15 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed. You can use this ability once per long rest.
- **Elemental Channeling:** When you cast a spell that deals cold damage, you can choose to deal bludgeoning damage instead. Additionally, when you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points, you can choose one creature affected by the spell. That creature gains temporary hit points equal to your druid level.

The waterskin can hold up to 2 gallons of water and weighs 2 pounds when full. It magically purifies any non-magical water placed inside it, making it safe to drink.
