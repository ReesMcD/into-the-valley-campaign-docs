# Thornbolt: The Elderose Whisper

Here's a magical hand crossbow for your D&D 5e game, inspired by the Elderose family, designed for stealth and incorporating poison damage:

**Thornbolt: The Elderose Whisper**

This elegantly crafted hand crossbow features intricate rose vine engravings along its stock and limbs. The metal has a deep, burnished copper hue reminiscent of autumn leaves. A small, crystalline rose blooms at the front of the crossbow, its petals seeming to shimmer with an inner light.

**Magical Properties:**

- +1 to attack and damage rolls
- Poison Thorn: Once per day, you can imbue a bolt with magical poison. On a hit, the target takes an extra 2d6 poison damage and must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute.
- Silent Shot: When you make an attack with this crossbow, you can choose to muffle the sound. The attack doesn't impose disadvantage on your Stealth check, and creatures have disadvantage on Perception checks to hear the shot.
- Rose Petal Cloak: As a bonus action, you can whisper the crossbow's command word to shroud yourself in illusory rose petals. You gain advantage on Stealth checks for 10 minutes or until you make an attack.

This unique weapon combines the Elderose family's association with roses, enhances stealth capabilities for assassin-like use, and incorporates poison damage as requested. The design and abilities are thematically linked to create a cohesive and flavorful magical item for your game.
