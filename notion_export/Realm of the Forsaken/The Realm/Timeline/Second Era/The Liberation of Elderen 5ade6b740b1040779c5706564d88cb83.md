According to an oracle, a great prophet would emerge to free the people from the oppressive rule of the Elves. This prophecy would eventually be fulfilled by Jessop Adrianus, who was born in the small town of Fordale.

Jessop was a natural prodigy, excelling in various fields such as magic, academics, politics, and even knighthood. He soon gained a following, with many believing him to be cut from the gods. At the young age of 27, Jessop amassed a great army and earned the support of many non-Elf populations in Elderen. Even Wood Elves began to follow him, which further added to his reputation and power.

As High King Adrianus, he led a 74-year campaign to drive the High Elves out of Elderen. This was a bloody and seemingly never-ending war, where countless High Elves, including civilians, were slaughtered by the Adrianus army. As the war dragged on, many Elven families fled to the untamed lands, which would eventually become the land of Dandillo.

High King Adrianus’ greatest achievement within the war was defeating the Eleven Dragon Riders, a small collection of Elves known to bond with Dragons. While how King Adrianus defeated the dragon riders is lost to history, it was depicted in the Labyrinth of Tiamut that the High King became Bahamuts dragon rider and defated the Tiamut Dragon Riders alone. 

Despite the horrors of war, High King Adrianus persisted and eventually succeeded in driving out the last of the Elves. With this, he founded his new empire, which consisted of 10 holds. He was hailed as The Great Unifier, a title he deserved for his accomplishments in dethroning the Elves, freeing the people of Elderen, and forming a great empire. 

King Adrianus’ conquest became known as The Liberation of Elderen
