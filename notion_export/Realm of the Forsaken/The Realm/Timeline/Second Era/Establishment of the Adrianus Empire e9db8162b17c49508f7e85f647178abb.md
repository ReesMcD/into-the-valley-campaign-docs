- In his later years, King Adrianus, with the help of his council and son, established the 9 holds of Elderen, many built or established around the previous eleven cities.
- The king eventually passed peacefully, and the throne passed to his son, Randell Adrianus, who continued Jessop’s will in building the 9 hold.
- The effort took the rest of his son’s life but the Adrianus Empire lived in harmony for the rest of the 2nd era.
