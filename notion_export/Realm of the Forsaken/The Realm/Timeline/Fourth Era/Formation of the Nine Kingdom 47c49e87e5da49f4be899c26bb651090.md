# Formation of the Nine Kingdom

Tags: Elderen History, History

After the abolishment of the High King, the Council of Dukes made a momentous decision: every hold would act as an independent kingdom, with each former duke becoming a king in their own right. This change, while largely symbolic, had far-reaching consequences for the realm of Elderen.

At first, the newly formed kingdoms worked together fairly well, sharing resources and knowledge for the greater good. However, as time passed, these kingdoms became more territorial and adversarial towards each other, leading to a rise in conflicts and political instability.

This trend of independent kingdoms becoming more competitive and protective continued for decades, with each kingdom focused on its own interests rather than the greater good of Elderen. As a result, the realm was plagued by conflicts and tensions, making it difficult for anyone to prosper.
