# The Labyrinth of Tiamat

Deep beneath the White Keep lies an expansive and mysterious labyrinth, known as the Labyrinth of Tiamat. This ancient maze, long rumored but discovered by only a few, is a testament to the power and cunning of the Dragon Queen herself.

## Ever-Changing Paths

The Labyrinth of Tiamat is not a static construct. Its corridors and chambers shift and change, presenting new challenges to those who dare to enter. This constant flux ensures that no two journeys through the labyrinth are ever the same, adding an extra layer of difficulty for adventurers seeking to navigate its depths.

## Puzzles and Traps

Throughout the labyrinth, intruders face a myriad of puzzles and traps. These challenges range from complex riddles that test one's wit to deadly mechanical traps that threaten life and limb. Each obstacle is designed not only to impede progress but also to eliminate those deemed unworthy of reaching the labyrinth's deeper secrets.

## Kobold Inhabitants

The labyrinth is home to a significant population of kobolds. Some serve as loyal minions to Tiamat, maintaining the labyrinth and ensuring its traps remain functional. Others are simply inhabitants, having made the twisting corridors their home over generations. These kobolds have adapted to the ever-changing nature of their environment, developing unique skills to navigate and survive within the labyrinth.

## The Dragon Trials

Halfway through the labyrinth, those who have survived thus far face a crucial decision. They must choose a path corresponding to one of the chromatic dragon colors: red, blue, green, black, or white. This choice determines the nature of the trials they will face in the deeper parts of the labyrinth, each path presenting unique challenges themed around the chosen dragon type.

## Hidden History in Murals

The walls of the Labyrinth of Tiamat are adorned with intricate murals depicting forgotten history. These ancient artworks reveal scenes of great significance, including:

- Tiamat's triumph over Bahamut in an epic battle
- The Dragon Queen enlisting powerful dragon riders to her cause
- Bahamut's resurgence, marked by his choice of Jessop Adrianus as his champion dragon rider

These murals not only serve as a record of past events but also hint at the ongoing struggle between Tiamat and Bahamut, adding depth to the mythological significance of the labyrinth.

## A Test of Worth

The Labyrinth of Tiamat is more than just a maze or a dungeon. It is a crucible designed to test the mettle of those who enter. Only the most cunning, resilient, and powerful adventurers can hope to unravel its secrets and emerge victorious. For those who do, the rewards - be they knowledge, power, or treasure - are said to be beyond imagination.
