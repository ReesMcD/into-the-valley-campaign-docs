# Loose History

Brampsie, once a thriving farming community in the Kingdom of Egoleren, has seen its fair share of hardships. The town's history mirrors the tumultuous past of Egoleren itself.

In its early days, Brampsie was known for its fertile lands and bountiful harvests. However, as wars ravaged Egoleren, much of the surrounding farmland was rendered unusable, forcing the town to adapt.

The establishment of the Church of Pelor marked a significant moment in Brampsie's history, bringing hope and unity to the struggling community. For years, it was the only church of Pelor in the region, attracting pilgrims and solidifying the town's spiritual importance.

The recent attack by the Obyrith Order, resulting in the destruction of the church and the kidnapping of the chosen child, has left deep scars on the town. This event, coupled with the general decline of Egoleren under the rule of the sickly and reclusive King Salvador Blackburn, has pushed Brampsie into a state of uncertainty.

Now, the town relies heavily on passing traders for survival, its identity shifting from a farming community to a trade stopover. Despite these challenges, the people of Brampsie remain resilient, holding onto hope for a brighter future and the possible return of their chosen child.
