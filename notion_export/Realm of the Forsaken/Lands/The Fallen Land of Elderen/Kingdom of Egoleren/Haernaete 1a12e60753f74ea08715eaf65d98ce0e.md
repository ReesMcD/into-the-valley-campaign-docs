## Culture and Religion

Haernaete is the epicenter of the Church of Kylor's influence, with the religion gaining such popularity that it led to the kingdom's official religious declaration. This spiritual significance adds to the city's unique character within Egoleren.

## Economy

Unlike other parts of the kingdom, Haernaete's economy is heavily dependent on the North Ridge Trading Company (NRTC) for supplies and goods, as it cannot rely on the rest of the war-torn kingdom for resources.

## Strategic Importance

As the capital of Egoleren and its only major city untouched by war, Haernaete holds significant strategic and symbolic importance within the kingdom and the broader region of the Fallen Land of Elderen.
