# Description

Kaloyte is the capital of the [Kingdom of Kalnaer](../Kingdom%20of%20Kalnaer%20d60e86090bdb45089ccf76759fab8f22.md), ruled by the [Kals](../../../Organizations/The%20Kal%20Royal%20Family%207e050c17a8b94062a598f74fb078f1ff.md), a long line of dwarves who have governed the land for generations. The city is surrounded by stone walls and features a large grey stone castle called Rocborne Deep. The Upper District consists of stone buildings that surround the castle, while the majority of the city is made up of stacked wooden shops and homes, creating many market squares.

Overall, Kaloyte may appear dull and unremarkable, but its history and significance to the Kingdom of Kalnaer make it a noteworthy location for those who appreciate the nuances of history and architecture.

# Locations in Kaloyte

## Rocborne Deep

Rocborne Deep is not just any ordinary castle - it is the castle of the Kal Royal Family. Built upon the remains of an old elven castle, the castle gets its name and various statues of Rocs from the previous structure. The castle is surrounded by walls that serve not only as protection, but also house stables, training areas, store rooms, and guard barracks within its courtyard, making it a self-sustaining fortress.

The castle is centered around the great mead hall, which is where the King and his family hold their grand feasts. Each of the wings and towers of the castle is dedicated to other members of the Kal Royal family, with each wing and tower representing a different branch of the family. For instance, the East Wing is dedicated to the Prince and his royal court, while the West Wing is reserved for the King's trusted advisors.

The King's Room is located atop the center tower and is a sight to behold. It contains a personal armory where the King's finest weapons are kept, a library filled with ancient tomes and scrolls, and a balcony that provides an unparalleled view of the surrounding lands.

Below the castle are catacombs that date back generations, providing a glimpse into the history of the Kal Royal Family. But deeper within the catacombs lies an ancient elven crypt that has remained untouched for generations, shrouded in mystery and legend. The tomb contains a Elven Gate that leads to the plane of Mount Celestia, as well as the skeleton of a dragon and elf. A secret entrance into the castle is located a few miles away from the city that leads to the catacombs, adding to the castle's intrigue and mystique.

## The Modest Drow

The tavern and inn, a popular hangout spot for members of the notorious [Red Chaos](../../../Organizations/Red%20Chaos%202e14eab8dd3d4da8861f34d20ee05e75.md), was a rundown and dingy establishment that had seen better days. Although it appeared to be just like any other dive bar, with its sticky floors and dim lighting, the Red Chaos had taken over the cellar and were using it for their illicit operations. This included everything from storing illegal weapons to conducting secret meetings and transactions with their criminal associates. Despite the best efforts of the local authorities to shut down the Red Chaos and their illegal activities, the tavern continued to be a hub of criminal activity and a source of fear for the surrounding community.

## The Twin Princess

Located in the main square of the city, the Twin Princess is a popular hangout spot for many city guards who come here to relax and unwind after a long day of work. The tavern itself is a small and modest wooden building, but it has a cozy and welcoming atmosphere that draws people in.

This means that the store is not just a place to buy unique goods, but it is also a hub for backdoor dealings that take place in secret. The store is run by [Mirabel Ronwarst](../../../NPCs/Irrelevent%20NPCs/Mirabel%20Ronwarst%2081672aa81738408d97c758c7c8955fb5.md), who is known for her shrewd business practices and ability to get her hands on hard-to-find items.
