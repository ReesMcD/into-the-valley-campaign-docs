# Description

The dwarven mining town is a bustling hub of activity, with a significant military presence and a large number of miners working tirelessly day and night to extract valuable resources from the earth. The town itself is built into the quarry that the miners are excavating, and the complex network of tunnels and passageways that crisscross the area is a testament to the determination and skill of the dwarves who call this place home.

The primary resources that the miners are seeking are iron, steel, and mithril, all of which are in high demand across the region. However, the mines are not without their dangers, as the tunnels often lead to unexpected places and hidden chambers filled with dangerous creatures and traps.

One such danger lies in the Duergar dungeon city that rests deep within the mines. The Kals, the ruling clan of the dwarves in this region, have been unable to reach the city, as it is fiercely protected by the Duergar who covet the great wealth within the elves' underground tomb. Although the Duergar have never been able to access the tomb, they continue to guard it fiercely, using their dark magic and cunning tactics to keep intruders at bay.

Despite the challenges and dangers within the dwarven mining town, it remains a vital center of industry and commerce, providing valuable resources to those brave enough to venture into its depths and emerge victorious. Whether you are a miner looking to strike it rich or a merchant seeking to buy and sell the finest metals and gems, this bustling town has something for everyone.

After being saved by the Nights of Kale, the city that defeated a mind flayer and saved them from a zombie army, the city of Duargate is on the rise. Many of the issues plaguing them are now solved.
