# History

This small town, which used to have a small but fruitful mine, played a significant role in the region's economy. However, the mine eventually ran dry due to overworking and natural depletion, leaving the town with limited means to sustain itself. However, recent discoveries have shed new light on the town's history. Elven ruins were found below the town, providing clues to its past and connections to a nearby castle. The discovery of these ruins has sparked renewed interest in the town's history, with many historians and archaeologists flocking to the area to learn more. In particular, the NRTC has taken a keen interest in the site and has started excavating the town. The excavation started with the old mine but has since expanded to the town. Unfortunately, the excavation work has displaced many of the town's citizens, leaving them without a home or a source of livelihood. As a result, the town is currently going through a period of transition, as it grapples with the consequences of its rich history being uncovered and the impact of the excavation work on its citizens.
