# History

- Originally ruled by elves
- A dwarven family, the Kals ruled the land
- The Kals have been passive and uncaring rulers, some think they are puppets
- The Kals are more concerned with leisure
- The Kals live in Kaloyte, the kingdoms capital
- Kaloyte is a dim underling city but is build around an old elven castle of Rocborne Deep
- The Kals are indebted to the North Ridge Trading Company and they control many of the Kals decisions
- Goblins have been attacking many of the towns of Kalnaer but the royal family cares little
- The Red Chaos is aiding the Goblins with hope to destabilize the Kal and NRTC
- Attack from the Obyrith Order have left Kalnaer in ruin. Stonepost, a once prospering village was decimated by the cult leaving no survivors. The Obyrith order raised their victims from the dead and led them to Duargate in search for the Key to the Abyss. Luckily the Nights of Kale saved the town trapping the zombies in an underground dungeon. But the march from Stonepost to Duargate left its everlasting mark on the kingdom.
