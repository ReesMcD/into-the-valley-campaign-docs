# Overview

![IMG_0013.jpeg](The%20Fallen%20Land%20of%20Elderen/IMG_0013.jpeg)

- Map Info
    
    This map and two more of its like were drawn and inscribed by Doyle & Sons of the Upright Company of Scribes of Catun upon commission by the esteemed Duke Mataren of Ilara, Duke Timas of Ravell, and Duke Aernar of Raefun.
    
    These maps depict the boundaries and fiefs of the nine holds of the Eld according to the Second Charter of Wolshom, signed in the two-hundred and twenty-fourth year of the Fourth Era after the conclusion of the War of Forn Valley and the dissolution of the hold of Blythe upon the death of Duke Mylas, last of his line.
    

# Description

Nestled in the valley of the Forncroft Mountains is the Fallen Land of Elderen, a once great empire shattered into nine kingdoms of its former holds. As more than a hundred years have passed since the death of the once High King, the now kingdoms still struggle to adjust to their new independence.
