## Ravencall: A Town in the Shadow of the Wyrm Spine

Nestled at the foot of the imposing Wyrm Spine mountains, Ravencall is a unique and vibrant town that blends human ingenuity with kobold craftiness. The town's layout reflects its diverse population, with winding streets that accommodate both human and kobold-sized residents.

### Notable Establishments

- The Draconic Forge: A blacksmith shop run by a skilled kobold artisan, known for creating intricate mechanisms and lightweight armor.
- The Raven's Roost Tavern: A popular gathering spot with different levels to accommodate patrons of various sizes. Famous for its "Wyrm's Breath" ale.
- Mountain Treasures: A curiosity shop specializing in rare mountain herbs and kobold trinkets.
- Echoing Halls Keep: The town's fortification, featuring a unique acoustic design that amplifies sounds, serving as both defense and communication system.
- The Harmony House: A music hall where human and kobold musicians collaborate, creating a distinctive "mountain melody" genre.
- Bahamut's Monastery: A majestic temple carved into the face of the Wyrm Spine mountains, dedicated to the worship of Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon. This awe-inspiring structure features intricate draconic architecture and serves as a pilgrimage site for both human and kobold followers of the dragon god. The monastery is known for its breathtaking views, peaceful meditation gardens, and a grand hall adorned with platinum dragon scales, said to have been gifted by Bahamut himself.

### Quirks and Traditions

- The Moonlight Market: A monthly night market where trades are conducted under the light of the moon, believed to bring good fortune to both buyers and sellers.
- Scale Weaving: A craft unique to Ravencall, where kobolds teach humans to weave intricate patterns using shed dragon scales, symbolizing unity between the races.
- The Echo Festival: An annual event where townspeople gather in the mountain caves to sing and create echoes, believed to ward off evil spirits.
- Raven Messengers: Instead of typical courier systems, Ravencall uses trained ravens to deliver messages within the town and to nearby settlements.

Ravencall's integration of kobold defectors from the mountain monastery has created a truly unique culture. The town serves as a model of cooperation between humans and kobolds, with both races contributing their strengths to create a thriving community in the shadow of the Wyrm Spine.
