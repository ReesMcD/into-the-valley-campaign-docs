# Description

Stonepost was a charming town notable for its unique architecture, comprised mainly of stone. The town got its name from the abundant stone deposits and rock formations in the surrounding areas. Alavor Ramsmith was a miner from Duargate who moved to the area and built the town from scratch. Thanks to his efforts, the town boasted a tavern, blacksmith, and general store frequented by locals and visitors alike. The town's stone-based construction also contributed to its unique charm and character, with many buildings featuring intricate stonework that was both beautiful and functional.

Stonepost is in disrepair as the Obyrith Order and the Firenewts destroyed the town and its population. 

# History

Stonepost was once a small town that served the nearby Dorgaete Castle, but after the castle was abandoned, the town began to decline. However, Alavor Ramsmith moved to the town and used his mining and building experience from his days in Duargate to find stone around the town and build it up. He worked tirelessly to turn the town into a thriving community, and over the years, people began to move to Stonepost, crediting Alavor with giving the town a new sense of purpose.

Alavor became known as the town's unofficial mayor, and his reputation as the town's savior grew as he worked to improve the lives of those who lived there. He built new houses, shops, and infrastructure, and even started a local school to educate the children of Stonepost.

However, in 353 4E, the Obyrith Order discovered an artifact in Dorgaete Castle. They used this artifact to raise an undead army, which they sent to attack Stonepost. The town was decimated, and most of its inhabitants were killed. But even in the face of this tragedy, Alavor's legacy lived on, as the surviving members of the community remembered the great things he had done for them and vowed to rebuild their beloved town in his honor.

When word spread that Stonepost was abandoned, a bandit gang known as the Firenewts took control of Stonepost for a short time before they were disposed of by the Nights of Kale, who were passing through.
