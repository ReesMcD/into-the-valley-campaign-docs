### The Reign of King Brytna

In Aurili of 214 4E, as winter began to take hold, the great and merciful Larell, Duke of Blythe and High King of the Eld, passed from this world to take his place beside our lord Kylor. His nephew Brytna, the new Duke of Blythe, was elected as High King, as his uncle and grandfather had been before him. The people were confident that he would continue the legacy of his line and uphold the traditions of Eld society and culture. The first four years of his reign were fruitful and free from strife as the young king held court in his seat of Fordale. He listened to the wisdom and guidance of his advisors and fellow Dukes, and the decades of peace and amity throughout the holds endured. But this was not to last.

In the spring of 219 4E, King Brytna decided to journey across Elderen, taking his court with him as he travelled. During his stay, he attended the hearings of the Dukes and their subjects, and imposed his judgment without regard to the particular laws and customs of each hold. In the following year, he decreed a new law stating that all keyna, a method democratically deciding which laws would be enforced within a hold, may only be issued by his new regiment of royal retainers, the King's Justice, whom he sent across Elderen and into every hold. In doing so, he stripped all judicial power from the people and their true monarchs, and placed armed warriors in their demesne. Blind to the turmoil and suffering caused by the injustice of his actions, King Brytna continued on this path as he sought to expand his power and force his will upon all. When he demanded that all holds and dominions within them give their young men to form a new royal army under his command in Eldale of 222 4E, the Dukes at last refused.

### The War of Forn Valley

When the Dukes refused the unjust demands and sought to parley, King Brytna instead sent his Kingsmen to press their subjects into his service. Any who opposed them were struck down where they stood. In the dusk of Llirale, six of their number were stopped near Seltarn, only for more of them to fall upon their captors like vicious beasts from where they hid. Putting the blame on the fallen, he called for all the holds to raise their men against the Duke of Ravell. But all saw through his lies, recognizing his wickedness, and vowed to depose the tyrant.

In Silvanule, the guard of Ravell lay siege to the stronghold of Inverkay. A force of one thousand under the Jackdaw, Sir Galett Baston, marched from Fordale to meet them only to be caught unawares and defeated in the Battle of the Craneswood by the men of Ilara and Raefun. His greatest warrior captured and the bulk of his army scattered or slain, the High King cowered behind his walls throughout the winter months while the ducal forces captured Inverkay and the castles of Kaedhom and Hawsglyn. When at last the spring melt arrived, the true men of Elderen advanced and surrounded the city of Fordale. For three months, it stood fast, repelling each attack on its walls, until one of the cravens inside opened the gate in exchange for silver and life. The Dukes led their men into the city, quickly subduing the enemies within, and marched towards the High King's palace whereupon they found the body of the King alongside his wife and children, all taken by the coward's own blade. With the tyrant now dead, the Dukes returned to their holds, and a calm spread out across Elderen.

### The Fire of Fordale

After the death of Brytna, his cousin Mylas was raised up as the new Duke of Blythe and started to repair the damage brought upon the hold by his predecessor. In Suneli, he was joined by the other Dukes at the castle of Wolshom where they drew up a new charter. With the years of conflict and unrest due to the abuse of the High King's power fresh in their memory, it was decided that none would be elected to the position. In its stead, a council was formed with each Duke's voice equal to that of their peers, to be called together when any threat faced the Eld people. The right to issue keyna was returned back to the nobles and lawmen of the land. Save the last outcries of those still loyal to the tyrant Brytna, peace reigned.

In Myrkule of that year, when the winter snow lay thick across the land, a fire erupted in Fordale. Its cause is still not known, be it by those seeking warmth in the dark nights, rifts emerging and igniting the dwellings, or the plotting of vengeful Kingsmen. The fire spread quickly, and before dawn crested, all of the city was ablaze. Many fled to the fields, but thousands were trapped by the heat and smoke, the flames carrying them from this world to Kylor's side. When the sun rose over the valley and the ash settled, the city stood no more. Those who survived were unable to rebuild in the snow and ice and so sought refuge amongst the other holds.

Amongst the dead were Duke Mylas of Blythe and many of his kin. The royal line of Blythe, descended from Saint Tork the Silent himself, ended that night with none left to take the ducal seat.
