### The Usurper Saint

- After the fallout of the Calamity many questioned the leadership of the Adrianus Royal Family.
- A small cult and religion following the lesser god Kylor begun to rise, a god not mentioned in the Dawn War Pantheon
- A prophet saint was said to be in their midst and would lead the kingdom to prosperity
- As this saint emerged many humans begun following Kylor and this saint.
- After calling for the King to step down and let the church take control of the kingdom war broke out within the kingdom.
- Many non humans stayed away from this conflict
- The follower of Kylor took down the Adrianus crown, anointing the saint as the sole leader of the kingdom.

### Lost of Faith

- As generation of inbreeding passed the crown strayed far from the church of Kylor. Its followers begun losing faith and falling back to their respective Dawn War deities.
- The crown remained stedfast they were one with the church but many citizens knew it to be merely symbolic.
