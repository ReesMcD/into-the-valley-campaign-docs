After years of peace and stability in the realm, the Cult of Nessus, a group dedicated to Asmodeus, broke open an ancient gate to Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells marking the beginning of the 3rd Era. This gate had been buried for millennia  and was rumored to be the key to unleashing unimaginable power. With the gate broken, devils and demons poured into the realm, wreaking havoc and destruction.

It was soon discovered that the archdevil Zariel was behind, influencing the cult for her own purposes. Zariel was a fallen angel and ruler of Avernus who had long been dedicated to winning the unending Blood War between devils and demons. Her plan was to open Avernus to the Material Plane and redirect the planar connection to the Abyss, thus ridding demons from Avernus. 

This event became known as The Calamity and plunged the entire realm into years of chaos and turmoil. Demons and devils fought each other relentlessly on the material plane, causing destruction and death wherever they went.

In the midst of this chaos, four great heroes emerged. They came together to defeat Zariel and seal the gate to Avernus once and for all. Journeying into Avernus, the four heroes faced unimaginable horrors but eventually slayed Zariel and closed the gate. However, in the process, they became trapped in Avernus, unable to return to the Material Plane.

Despite the defeat of Zariel, many devils and demons still roamed the realm, causing destruction and mayhem wherever they went. It took the actions of other heroes to finally defeat the lingering fiends and bring stability back to the realm.
