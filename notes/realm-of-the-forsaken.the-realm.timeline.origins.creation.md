During this time, the [[realm-of-the-forsaken.the-realm.gods|Dawn War Deities]], also known as the Gods, were a powerful force. They spent their time creating a variety of creatures, plants, and monsters, imbuing the Material Plane with magic that would last for generations. Despite fighting together in the Dawn War, these Gods did not always agree and some were even mortal enemies.

As each God tried to influence their own creations to dominate over those of other Gods, a great conflict arose. Creatures and monsters ran rampant across the Material Plane as the Gods vied for dominance. In response to this chaos, a few Gods decided to create a powerful species to rule over the Plane. This species possessed great magic, technology, and diplomacy, and brought stability to the Material Plane, but not everyone was pleased with their intervention.

Other Gods created the Elves to combat this ruling species. This sparked another war, ultimately leading to the eradication of the ancient species by the Elves. Sadly, their name, lineage, and culture were lost to time. In the aftermath of this conflict, the Elves harnessed the technology and magic of the ancient species to begin their own great rule over the Material Plane.

Not much more is known about this time, as a significant portion of its history was either destroyed or rewritten by the Elves.
