# Summary

Olympia is a wood elf adventurer who enjoys meeting new people and learning about their cultures. She was raised by otters and is deeply connected to water. She has a long-lost brother who is an evil druid, and she occasionally suffers visions of impending darkness.

She wants to protect and heal those she builds close bonds with, and dislikes those who are arrogant or harm nature.

# Backstory

Olympia does not remember exactly where she was born, but it was most likely in the outlands because all she knows is nature and the wandering lifestyle. Despite being attracted to nature, she enjoys meeting people and striking up conversations to learn about others, their cultures, and ways of life. She has taken up the wandering and adventuring lifestyle to meet new people, see new lands, learn more, and help others heal. She ended up in her current kingdom due to adventuring and strengthening her magic, as well as learning about other forms of magic.

Olympia was raised by otters and other river creatures. These otters, whom she considers family, introduced her to some of their cousins in the ocean so she could learn about different types of water. They taught her how to swim well, hold her breath, hunt for food, and about many aquatic or semi-aquatic creatures. Olympia is deeply connected to water and loves rivers, lakes, streams, creeks, waterfalls, and the ocean. Water has strong healing and flowing properties that bring her strength and joy.

Although Olympia does not remember much about her birthplace or her parents, she does remember having a long-lost brother who was attracted to electricity and fire. Olympia wants to reunite and reconnect with her brother. Those she builds close bonds with, like her adventuring party, she wants to protect and help heal because they remind her of her brother and otter clan. Overall, she is a kind person.

Occasionally, Olympia suffers visions of a coming disaster or darkness. Either she hears whispers from nature or sees it in her dreams. She wants to figure out what they mean and try to stop the spread or imbalance of darkness.

Olympia is spiritual and strongly connected to many gods and goddesses of nature. Although she respects these deities, she understands their flaws and does not follow strict religious practices.

Olympia has not met too many other elves. She is curious about her race and would like to learn more about them and meet more elves to see if they know anything about her past.

Olympia prefers casual and simple people and dislikes those who are arrogant or destroy nature with malicious intent.
