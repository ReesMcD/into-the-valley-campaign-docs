- Key Plot Points
    - The NRTC believes an elven gate is beneath the city, but a key is required to enter the tomb, and they are unable to progress.
    - An eleven-gate to the Abyss is located beneath the city.

# Description

- A small mining town that is under the control of the NRTC.
- Excavation has consumed the town as an elven tomb has been discovered underneath.

# History

This small town, which used to have a small but fruitful mine, played a significant role in the region's economy. However, the mine eventually ran dry due to overworking and natural depletion, leaving the town with limited means to sustain itself. However, recent discoveries have shed new light on the town's history. Elven ruins were found below the town, providing clues to its past and connections to a nearby castle. The discovery of these ruins has sparked renewed interest in the town's history, with many historians and archaeologists flocking to the area to learn more. In particular, the NRTC has taken a keen interest in the site and has started excavating the town. The excavation started with the old mine but has since expanded to the town. Unfortunately, the excavation work has displaced many of the town's citizens, leaving them without a home or a source of livelihood. As a result, the town is currently going through a period of transition, as it grapples with the consequences of its rich history being uncovered and the impact of the excavation work on its citizens.
