## Hand of Zokenth

*Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement by a sorcerer)*

This armored gauntlet, named after the legendary blue dragon Zokenth, glimmers with a faint blue hue. Imbued with ancient draconian magic, it gives off a mysterious aura and crackles with latent electrical energy.

### Lightning Mastery

While wearing the Hand of Zokenth, you gain the following benefits:

- You have resistance to lightning damage.
- You can cast the *lightning bolt* spell at 3rd level once per long rest without expending a spell slot.
- When you cast a spell that deals lightning damage, you can reroll any 1s on the damage dice. You must use the new rolls.

### Storm Channeling

As an action, you can channel the power of storm dragons through the gauntlet. For the next minute, your lightning spells ignore resistance to lightning damage, and you add your Charisma modifier to the damage rolls of your lightning spells. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Dragon's Wrath

When you hit a creature with a melee spell attack while wearing this gauntlet, you can expend 1 sorcery point to deal an extra 2d8 lightning damage to the target.

### Elven Legacy

The Hand of Zokenth resonates with its elven heritage. While attuned to it, you gain advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.

This powerful artifact serves as a reminder of the ancient bond between elves and dragons, particularly the majestic blue dragons of old.
