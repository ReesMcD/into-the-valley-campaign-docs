During the first era, the Elves not only tamed much of the bountiful land of the realm, particularly the land of [[realm-of-the-forsaken.lands.the-fallen-land-of-elderen|Elderen]], but also developed their culture, religion, and social structure. They built grand cities, magnificent temples, and impressive monuments that reflected their artistic and technological achievements. The first era was a time of prosperity and stability under the Elves, who expanded their empire and established diplomatic relations with other kingdoms. While rare, it was often mentioned that certain elves could bond with dragons, and a faction of Elves known as Dragon Riders we born, the first people to assimilate with Dragons. 

As generations of elves passed, different species of elves emerged, each with their own physical traits, cultural customs, and political affiliations. The High Elves, the most powerful and influential of all elves, formed a hierarchical society that governed the realm and controlled natural resources. The Wood Elves, skilled archers and hunters, inhabited the forests and lived in harmony with nature. The Dark Elves were shunned by High Elves because their respective Gods were enemies. Other lesser-known elves, such as Sea Elves, Snow Elves, and Desert Elves, also existed but played minor roles in the realm's history.

However, the unity and harmony among elves were short-lived. In an attempt to preserve their power and dominance, High Elves began to persecute other forms of Elves, either killing or banishing them to various outlands. Some species of elves vanished altogether, leaving only ruins and legends. The Wood Elves, who resented the High Elves' arrogance and oppression, rebelled against their rulers and formed their own independent communities. The Dark Elves, who had always been outcasts, allied themselves with evil forces and waged war against all elves. The realm was plunged into chaos and bloodshed.

During this time, other less powerful races, such as Humans and Dwarves, began to question the rule of Elves and demand more rights and freedoms. They formed alliances with rebel elves and launched attacks on the High Elf strongholds. The High Elves, beginning to fear outsiders, became more secretive and defensive. They hid their wealth, magic, and advanced technology from others and built barriers and traps to prevent intruders from entering their domains. The realm was divided, and a new era of darkness and uncertainty began.
