# Description

Kalnaer, a humble milling and lumber town that was once known for not much more than an inn, tavern, and general store, is now bustling with life as it prepares for the upcoming Festival of Light. The festival is a celebration of light, life, and peace and is held once every 10 years. It is one of the most sacred and historic traditions in Kalnaer, drawing visitors from far and wide to witness the festivities.

# History

Pinebach was founded due to its access to plentiful lumber and a kingdom of largely grasslands. This made it an ideal location for settlers to establish a thriving community.

Furthermore, Pinebach became home to the Festival of Light, an annual celebration that showcases the city's deep connection to religion and spirituality. It is particularly significant as it is home to the first Church of Pelor in the kingdom, attracting pilgrims and worshippers from far and wide.

However, not all was peaceful in Pinebach. The Obyrith Order, a notorious dark cult, launched a devastating attack on the Festival of Light in the year 353 4E. In a shocking turn of events, they managed to abduct the Chosen Child of Kalnaer, a young individual destined for greatness.

Pinebach emerged as a symbol of hope and resilience in the face of adversity. The town’s rich history, coupled with its unwavering spirit, continues to inspire generations to come.
