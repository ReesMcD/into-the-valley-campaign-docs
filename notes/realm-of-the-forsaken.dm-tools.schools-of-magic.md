| **School** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Abjuration | The most defensive school, focusing on protection, self-buffing, and counterspelling, ideal for Wizards aiming to counter other spellcasters. |
| Conjuration | Focuses on summoning creatures, creating objects, and high-damage single-target spells, making it a versatile and aggressive school. |
| Divination | Specializes in information gathering. It reveals new insights, from magical detection to language understanding. |
| Dunamancy | A unique school of magic focused on altering reality, not typically found in most Wizards of the Coast settings. |
| Enchantment | Focuses on manipulating the minds of others, either impairing opponents with status effects or enhancing allies’ abilities. |
| Evocation | Focuses on creating elemental forces, differing from Conjuration’s emphasis on creating magical constructs. |
| Illusion | Focuses on deceiving the senses, creating perceptions of things that aren’t there, making it highly dependent on the Dungeon Master’s (DM) engagement and interpretation. |
| Necromancy | A diverse offensive school centered around manipulating death, with spells often requiring a living or formerly living target, differing from the focus on combat control and damage found in Conjuration and Evocation. |
| Transmutation | Focused on altering the user or allies, primarily serving as a buffing school that modifies the user or environment rather than creating new elements, distinguishing it from Conjuration. |
