# Backstory

Hamqueef was born into slavery with the name Sol along with his twin sister Vay in the growing Queendom of Gossa. They both dreamed of escaping slavery and living a simple life, but this was a far-fetched dream. They worked as handmaids, servants, and jesters while enslaved by the great Elderose family, a line of incestuous High Elves known for their “pure” blood and unique magic. At a young age, both were declawed and sterilized, which made their lives even more difficult.

One day Sol lashed out at his masters for overworking Vay to the point of exhaustion. In response, their Elven masters killed Vay, stating that “if she can’t accomplish what we need she's not worth breathing our air.” This was a devastating loss for Sol, and he was left to mourn his sister and contemplate his future.

The Elderoses saw great potential in Sol, both as a slave and a potential tool for their various businesses. They wanted to use him for espionage, assassinations, and other criminal acts that they themselves did not want to do. He earned the name “The Elderose Thorn” and was even contracted by the Queendom. However, after the murder of his sister, Sol attacked his Eleven masters. He was restrained and kept alive because of his potential, but he was also punished and began his reeducation and correction process under the Elderoses.

Sol was isolated from the other slaves and began training in the art of stealth, assassination, and other rogue-like tactics in the hope to support the Elderrose family. Sol was under the supervision of Permaris Elderose, a veteran spy and assassin, who previously consulted for many criminal organizations around the realm. This period was harsh for Sol, but he was determined to escape and fulfill the dream he and his sister had.

At the age of 14, Sol was able to escape from the clutches of Permaris and the Elderose family. In the process he stole the Elderose sacred family heirloom, The Elderose.

Sol eventually stowed away with a traveling circus where he could perform and act to make some extra coin and quietly move away from the Elderose’s reach. Sol turned to the drink, to cover his pain of the past. While with this circus Sol was allured to a “fortune teller” and witch. Sol was tortured with the pain of his lost sister, blaming himself for her death. He wanted the witch to take his pain away.

The witch stole all of Sol’s memories, but in a way the pain was still there. When he awoke, Sol could not remember his name or why he was alone in the forest’s of Elderen, with no Elderose. Unknowing where he was or who he was, Sol adopted the name Hamqueef and wandered the lands of Elderen searching for purpose. He did this for five or so years before making his way to Pinebach in the Kingdom of Kalnaer.
