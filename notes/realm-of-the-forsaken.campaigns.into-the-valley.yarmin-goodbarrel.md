# Summary

# Backstory

Yarmin Goodbarrel owned a pub in a river town in Raza of Oliphant Pori, but it burned down with a mystical blue flame, killing his wife and two children. He found a hidden room in the cellar with a glowing blue longsword and a journal that mentioned the sword's power and dark sway. Yarmin left home seeking answers and is slightly seduced by the sword's powers, but not aligned with his patron. The patron likely caused the fire and saved Yarmin's life, forming a pact and transporting him to the Nine Kingdoms.
