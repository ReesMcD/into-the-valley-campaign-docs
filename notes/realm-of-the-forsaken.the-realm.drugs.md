Drugs and Addictive Substances
T

his supplement outlines the addictive nature of
various substances and drugs in the fantasy
world. This supplement is not meant to
condone nor encourage any drug use, but to
offer a guideline for DMs to incorporate these
substances into their game.

Addiction
Drugs can offer some handy benefits to characters, but they
do have their drawbacks. When characters use a drug they
make a Constitution check against the Addiction Rating of
that drug. On a failed save the character becomes addicted
and sufferers from the effects in the chart below.
Addiction Rating
Con
DC
Addiction
Rating Satiation Damage
4 Negligible 1 day 1 Exhaustion
6 Low 10 days +1 Exhaustion
10 Medium 5 days +1 Exhaustion -2 Charisma
14 High 2 days +1 Exhaustion -2 Charisma, -2
Wisdom
20 Extreme 1 day +1 Exhaustion -4 Charisma, -4
Wisdom
25 Vicious 1 day +1 Exhaustion, -4 Charisma, -4
Wisdom, -2 Strength
With Negligibly addictive drugs, it is impossible to exceed
level 1 exhaustion from withdrawals under normal
circumstances
Prolonged Use: Long-term use can increase the addiction
rating of a drug. All drugs increase their rating by one step for
every two months a PC uses them. Negligible drugs are
immune to this effect
Satiation: Satiation is the time that passes before a
character, whom is addicted to a drug, needs another hit or
starts to suffer from withdrawals. The first satiation period
begins at the dose that makes the character addicted.
Damage: Damage is dealt to a character's ability scores
and exhaustion level each day outside of the satiation period.
This can be prevented by a successful Constitution saving
throw or by taking another dose of the drug. This damage is
healed at a rate of 1 point in each ability score per day.
Recovery: If a character makes two successful
Constitution saving throws in a row, the character has fought
off addiction and recovers, taking no more damage.
Poison Resistance/Immunity
If a character is immune to poisons, drugs will have
no effect on them unless otherwise noted.
If a character is resistant to poison, they have
advantage on Addiction and Effect saving throws.

Addiction Madness
If a character goes too long without a drug they are
addicted to, they have a chance at going mad. After
a certain amount of time without the drug the
character has to make a Constitution saving throw
against the addiction rating. If they fail they roll on
the madness tables.

Drug Effects
Drug effects are treated much like poisons. The character
must first make a Constitution saving throw against the
Addiction Rating of a drug, followed by a Constitution saving
throw against the Effect Save DC. Upon a fail, the character
takes on the initial effects of the drug. If the drug has a
secondary effect, after the character takes on the initial
effects they must then roll another Constitution saving throw,
if they fail they take on the secondary effects aswell.
Effect DC is specific to each drug and can be found in it's
description.
Willing Consumption
If a character willingly takes a drug they
automatically fail both effect saves. The Effect Save
DC is provided for if a character is given the drug
against their will.

visions induced by dreammist, a user's normal life seems

compelled (similar to the effects of a suggestion spell) to
do whatever is necessary to obtain another dreammist
dose. This compulsion lasts for 1d4 hours before fading.

hour, or if raw mordayn or mordayn tea are ingested, the

prevent an overdose.
