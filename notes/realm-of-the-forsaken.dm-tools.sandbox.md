## Alchemy System for D&D 5e

### Introduction

Alchemy in Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition can add a layer of depth and creativity to your campaign. This system allows players to create potions, poisons, and other alchemical concoctions using various ingredients they find during their adventures.

### Alchemical Ingredients

Ingredients are categorized into three tiers based on their rarity:

- **Common Ingredients:** Easy to find and inexpensive (e.g., herbs, minerals).
- **Uncommon Ingredients:** Require effort to find or purchase (e.g., rare plants, special crystals).
- **Rare Ingredients:** Hard to find and expensive, often guarded by powerful creatures (e.g., dragon's blood, unicorn horn).

### Alchemical Tools

To perform alchemy, a character needs:

- **Alchemist's Supplies:** Includes a mortar and pestle, vials, chemicals, and other essentials.
- **Recipe Book:** Contains instructions for creating various alchemical items.

### Alchemical Formulas

Here's a sample of formulas that can be included in your alchemy system:

### Healing Potion (Common)

- **Ingredients:** 1 Common Herb, 1 Vial of Pure Water
- **DC:** 10
- **Effect:** Heals 2d4 + 2 HP

### Firebomb (Uncommon)

### Crafting Process

1. **Ingredient Gathering:** Players must gather or purchase the required ingredients.
2. **Preparation:** The character spends 1 hour preparing the ingredients.
3. **Crafting Check:** The player makes an Intelligence (Alchemy) check against the DC of the item they are trying to create.
    - **Success:** The item is created successfully.
    - **Failure:** The ingredients are wasted.

### Optional Rules

- **Enhanced Crafting:** Allow proficiency with Alchemist's Supplies to add a bonus to crafting checks.
- **Experimentation:** Characters can attempt to create new formulas by combining different ingredients and making a high DC crafting check.
- **Quality Variations:** Items can have varying qualities based on the crafting check result (e.g., higher rolls result in more potent effects).

### Conclusion

Implementing this alchemy system can provide players with a rewarding and immersive experience, encouraging exploration and creativity in their adventures.
